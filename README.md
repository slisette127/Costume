# Costume

Instructions

In the README.md, list out the data you think you'll need for this app.
Categorize the data into tables
Define relationships between those tables
Using any digital tool you like, construct an ER diagram that communicates those tables, their relationships and their fields/properties.
Save a copy of this ER Diagram in the repo.
Review the steps to create a DB, connect to it, seed it with data and write them down in the README.md.
Write the SQL Commands that would create the tables in files named after the data like: userSeedData.sql, carSeedData.sql, productSeedData.sql, etc...
Store those files in the repo
Upload the repo's link to the Checkpoint-2 Assignment

Instructions


Using any digital tool you like, construct an ER diagram that communicates those tables, their relationships and their fields/properties.
Save a copy of this ER Diagram in the repo.
Review the steps to create a DB, connect to it, seed it with data and write them down in the README.md.
Write the SQL Commands that would create the tables in files named after the data like: userSeedData.sql, carSeedData.sql, productSeedData.sql, etc...
Store those files in the repo
Upload the repo's link to the Checkpoint-2 Assignment
